Food and nutrition are the ways that we get fuel, providing energy for our bodies. We need to replace nutrients in our bodies with a new supply every day. Water is an important component of nutrition. Fats, proteins, and carbohydrates are all required. Nutrition is the science that interprets the nutrients and other substances in food concerning the maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes ingestion, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion.

Knowing and eating mindfully is not only essential for a healthy gut but also for peace of mind. Also,A diet filled with vegetables, fruits and whole grains could help prevent major conditions such as stroke, diabetes and heart disease.More often than not, we like to gorge on our favourite foods which are not exactly the best for our bodies.While it is okay for such binges to occur occasionally, such diets can be extremely harmful if the person does not strike a balance with healthy foods.
